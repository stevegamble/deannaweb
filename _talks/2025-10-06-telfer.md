Objective: To introduce PhD students in a Learning Health Systems seminar to how data democratization, analytics, and data governance enable a Learning Health System, using real-world examples from a large academic health organization. The presentation aims to illustrate how accessible, high‑quality data and data literacy can accelerate evidence generation, support decision‑making, and translate data into improved care, research, and system performance.
