I am a seasoned leader in healthcare data analytics with over 30 years of experience transforming health data into actionable insights for decision-making and research. I hold a Master’s degree in Statistics and currently serve as Director of Analytics at The Ottawa Hospital and a Senior Investigator at The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute. I am passionate about democratizing data for leaders, researchers, and innovators to improve care quality, advance research, and support innovation.

Under my leadership, the Analytics team became the first in Canada to implement an enterprise “single source of truth” data warehouse alongside a centralized intake process for data requests. Today, this modern data ecosystem leverages Epic’s infrastructure and self-serve tools like SlicerDicer and Radar dashboards, giving users fast and reliable access to data at their fingertips.

To promote data literacy and build capacity, the Analytics team also delivers a range of education courses on self-serve tools and key subject areas—empowering teams across the hospital to use data to drive improvements in care delivery.
